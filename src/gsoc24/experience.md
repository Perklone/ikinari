"title" : "Two-time the charm! Google Summer of Code 2024 for Scala Center"

Who would have thought that I would be participating in Google Summer of Code again! I certainly didnâ€™t, but here we are. It has been an amazing and difficult experience, and also really rewarding. I hope that this writing motivates anyone that wants to participate in this great program and learn from my experience. The project started from May, and ended on August (I chose the medium-sized project)

If you want to learn more about the project itself, you can access it [here]("https://miggy.moe/gsoc24") or click on the Home section.

It is important to note that I participated in this project without ever writing a single line of Scala code, by the time I got accepted to this program, I have tried playing around with the language, but I was nowhere near proficient with it, more-so with the ecosystem with it. The reason on why I chose this project, because at that time, I am really interested in working with command-line tool and something beyond CRUD work. As I searched through the list of project ideas from the organization lists, I stumbled across Scala Center page, and I found exactly what I wanted to do.

The first thing that I did before I create my proposal is to email my to-be mentor, Jamie. I asked him about what to expect in this project, how big is the scope of work going to be, and asked if I can try creating a proposal to work on this for this year GSoC. We then create a meeting to discuss the point that I brought up, and told me that I should go ahead and participate.

A week after the initial meeting which around early April, I was called for an interview to discuss regarding my experience, motivation and technical abilities for this project. After the interview process, all I have to do is waiting if the good news will come. Fortunately, it did. on May 2nd, I received the informal email that I have been accepted to work on Scala Center.

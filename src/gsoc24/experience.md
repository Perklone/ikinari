Who would have thought that I would be participating in Google Summer of Code again! I certainly didn’t, but here we are. It has been an amazing and difficult experience, and also really rewarding. I hope that this writing motivates anyone that wants to participate in this great program and learn from my experience.

I would like to give a massive shoutout to my mentor on this project, Jamie Thompson and Kannupriya Kalra, because without them, I definitely wouldn’t be able to complete this project. They have been the best in showing me the rope on working at Scala in the Scala-CLI codebase.

The project I’m working for the Scala Center is “Scala-CLI Source Code Generator Support”. Scala-CLI is a command line tool that allows running, testing and packaging Scala code. It’s a much smaller, more compact build tool compared to other Scala build tool such as sbt. 

The idea for this project comes from the issue page in this page: [Support code generators · Issue \#610 · VirtusLab/scala-cli](https://github.com/VirtusLab/scala-cli/issues/610). The goals are to support code creation with generator in Scala-CLI. It is commonly used for generating code from data format file such as Protobuf and Smithy. With this you don’t have to manually create the code from your data format file.

It is important to note that I participated in this project without ever writing a single line of Scala code, by the time I got accepted to this program, I have tried playing around with the language, but I was nowhere near proficient with it, more-so with the ecosystem with it. The reason on why I chose this project, because at that time, I am really interested in working with command-line tool and something beyond CRUD work. As I searched through the list of project ideas from the organization lists, I stumbled across Scala Center page, and I found exactly what I wanted to do.

The first thing that I did before I create my proposal is to email my to-be mentor, Jamie. I asked him about what to expect in this project, how big is the scope of work going to be, and asked if I can try creating a proposal to work on this for this year GSoC. We then create a meeting to discuss the point that I brought up, and told me that I should go ahead and participate.

A week after the initial meeting which around early April, I was called for an interview to discuss regarding my experience, motivation and technical abilities for this project. After the interview process, all I have to do is waiting if the good news will come. Fortunately, it did. on May 2nd, I received the informal email that I have been accepted to work on Scala Center.

## Overview
Hello! My name is [Rizky Maulana]("https://www.linkedin.com/in/rizky-maulana01/"), This is the master page of everything that I did for 2024 Google Summer of Code program, working for Scala Center.

I worked on Scala-CLI, a command line tool to interact with the Scala Language. The motivation behind this project is to catch-up with Scala's other build tool, [sbt]("https://www.scala-sbt.org/") and other popular build tool from other languages. The goals are to support code creation with generator in Scala-CLI. It is commonly used for generating code from data format file such as Protobuf and Smithy. With this you don’t have to manually create the code from your data format file.

I would like to give a massive shoutout to my mentors, [Kannupriya Kalra]("https://www.linkedin.com/in/kannupriyakalra/") and [Jamie Thompson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-richard-thompson/)  because without them, I definitely wouldn’t be able to complete this project. They have been the best in showing me the rope on working at Scala in the Scala-CLI codebase.
